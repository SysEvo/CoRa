        ###The tag was replaced from "io" to "outfile1" with the intention of creating a "report card" output file down the line, which would necessitate the existence of multiple output files

                ###Up next, we must find the steady states of both ssR and soR, while also checking that the process itself didn't fail. Let's make that a single, "fn.SSandCheck()" function
                ssR, soR, rtol = fn.SSandCheck(p, x0, 1e-12, mm)
                ###Now, we have to do the Perturbation itself!
                ssD, soD = fn.Perturbation(ssR, soR, p, rtol, mm, pert)
                ###And we must return CoRa now, too
                CoRa[k] = fn.CoRa(mm.outFB(ssR), mm.outFB(ssD), mm.outNF(soR), mm.outNF(soD))
                ###With everything done, it's time to output them into the file!
                ###Check this one out
                ###And we reset our perturbation for the next run of the loop
