        ###The tag was replaced from "io" to "outfile1" with the intention of creating a "report card" output file down the line, which would necessitate the existence of multiple output files

                ###Up next, we must find the steady states of both ssR and soR, while also checking that the process itself didn't fail. Let's make that a single, "fn.SSandCheck()" function

                ###With everything done, it's time to output them into the file!
                ###Check this one out
                ###And we reset our perturbation for the next run of the loop
                p[pert.c] = p0[pert.c];
